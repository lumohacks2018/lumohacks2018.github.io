            <a href="http://frontline-help.com"><b>Frontline</b></a> is a Natural Language Processing interactive chatbot which provides personalized and localized support for friends and family of veterans and  those suffering from PTSD. The project was created during September 15-16, 2018 for <a href="http://www.lumohacks.com/">Lumohacks</a>, a health-focused hackathon.

        <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
            By nature of their occupation, first responders and veterans are more vulnerable to mental illnesses such as PTSD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our question is - How do we reach out and support them? How can we, <i>as a society</i>, make a difference?
        </p>

        <h1>Target Market</h1>
        <p>
            We start with the people you care about - friends, family, acquaintances. These people are one degree from those who are vulnerable or suffering, and are best positioned to be an emotional support.
        </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>
            The following 3 personas are examples of expected users for this project.
        </p>
        </main>

    <div class="horizontal_gallery_container">
        <div class="horizontal_gallery"><img src="assets/img/persona1.png" alt="Persona 1" width="380"></div>
        <div class="horizontal_gallery"><img src="assets/img/persona2.png" alt="Persona 2" width="380"></div>
        <div class="horizontal_gallery"><img src="assets/img/persona3.png" alt="Persona 3" width="380"></div>
    </div>

    <main>
        <p>
            Most importantly, people who are one degree from those suffering need the <i>professional guidance and support</i> in order to appropriately reach out and provide care.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>We believe that the friends and family of those vulnerable to PTSD should be able to have the support and resources they need to reach out to the people close to them in need of help.</b>
        </p>

        <h1>Solution</h1>

        <p>
            Our solution is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot which provides personalized and localized support for those who are one-degree from veterans and those vulnerable to PTSD.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users interact and converse with Frontline which is trained to understand emotions and symptom descriptions relevant to someone suffering from PTSD. In the case that a user displays signs of imminent risk or danger, such as suicidal intentions, Frontline has been trained to immediately provide hotlines to call.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user may interact with Frontline on the <a href="http://frontline-help.com">website</a> or on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HereToHelp.lumohacks/">Facebook</a>. When on Facebook, Frontline has the additional feature of being able to give control of the chat to a real person (an administrator of the Facebook page).

        <p>
            <a href="assets/img/domaincom.png">Domain.com</a> as the DNS management host.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a> as host for the website and for Google Dialogflow.
        </p>

        <h1>Positioning</h1>

        <p>
            In relation to <i>current counselling and chat services</i> (e.g. <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/health/support/mental-health/my-ssp.html">My SSP</a>), this augments their effectiveness by directing users to resources which are appropriate and relevant to their situation. Users will often learn about resources they were not previously aware of, so this aids in content discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
            This would make <i>peer support</i> stronger and more educated by providing directly pertinent information.
        </p>

        <h1>Objectives</h1>
        <p>
            The end objectives of this project is to <i>educate and empower</i> the community to be able to help others, and to create a <i>localized social impact</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            They say “It takes a village to raise a child.”
        </p>
        <p>
            It also takes a community to heal - <b>together</b>.
        </p>
